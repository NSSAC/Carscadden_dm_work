Given $C$ is it possible to reach $C^{'}$?

while $C \neq C^{'}$

\indent for infected node in $C$

\indent\indent for neighbor of infected node:

\indent\indent\indent if neighbor state is $\geq$ neighbor state in $C^{'}$

\indent\indent\indent\indent return False (System is progressive)

\indent\indent\indent update state of neighbor(check the state of the neighbor's neighbors of which it has at most $V$)

\indent if no state is updated

\indent\indent return False


I believe the above is $O(V^{4})$
