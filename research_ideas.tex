\section{Previous Work:}
The work in \cite{10.1145/2339530.2339601} mainly focuses on infectivity ratios to understand the co-existence threshold; furthermore, there is an assumption of homogeneous mixing, so novel research may reveal that conclusions achieved in \cite{10.1145/2339530.2339601} may not hold for other graph structures. The work in \cite{Karrer_2011} assumes cross-immunity whereas this work will assume independence. This affects the graph structure. Additionally, many of the conclusions of \cite{Karrer_2011} focus on the co-existence threshold as the number of nodes grows to infinity. They discuss some of the changes that finite-size effects have but do not explore this fully.

\section{Influence of graph structures on co-existence} 
\subsection{Model}
    We will be using the SIR SyDS model with some modifications. There will be two
    contagions $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$. The underlying graph, $G(V,E)$, will be a directed graph
    containing nodes $V$ with five possible states susceptible, $I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{1}I_{2}$, and recovered. Each edge will contain two probabilities $p_{I_{1}}$ and $p_{I_{2}}$ that correspond to the probability of transmitting $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ respectively. \\ \\ 
    The transition time from susceptible to recovered/removed will be specified by a random variable shared by the contagions and, likewise, for recovered/removed to susceptible. Assume that contagions are independent of each other.
\subsection{Experiment Idea 1}
    Choose two seed nodes that have a similar out-degree and run a simulation to see if the infections for both nodes
    converge to a fixed points. Each contagion will have it's edge probabilities selected from a random variable that holds constant across simulations. Simulations should be run where edge probabilities are selected from several cases: ecological neutrality case (\cite{LIPSITCH20092} dicsusses the importance of this) where the probabilities are i.i.d., the case where one distribution is slightly more infectious, and the case where one distribution is vastly more infectious.
    \\ \\
    Run simulations where the graph is tweaked  to exhibit more or less of a given type of structure. Use the outcomes of these trails to determine a threshold at which both infections co-exist in the limit. \\
    Properties to Test:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Degree distribution
        \item Assortativity:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $k_{nn}$ distribution
            \item Assortativity coefficient
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}


\section{Financial Contagions}
In \cite{CACCIOLI201550}, sources of risk that together create source of systemic risk which allows an epidemic of bankruptcy to spread through banking networks is discussed. There could be potential to explore the interaction between financial contagion and other forms such as social or disease.

\section{Graph Inference with Multiple Contagions}
There are many graph inference methods for social networks that rely on a single social contagion. These could be extended for networks on which we have information for multiple contagions to improve the accuracy of inference.
